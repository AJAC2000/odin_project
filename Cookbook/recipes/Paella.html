        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Paella is a vibrant and aromatic rice dish that hails from Spain, specifically the Valencia region. This one-pot wonder showcases a symphony of flavors, combining saffron-infused rice with an assortment of ingredients such as chicken, rabbit, seafood, vegetables, and spices, all slowly cooked together to create a harmonious medley.</p>

            <li>Heat olive oil in a large paella pan or wide skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Sear the chicken pieces and rabbit meat (if using) until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.</li>

            <li>Add the rice to the pan and stir to coat the grains with oil.</li>
